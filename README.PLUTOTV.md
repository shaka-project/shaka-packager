## Sync with Google code

- sync with Google main branch and make PR
- fix all merge conflicts

# Linux Dockers
we disable OpenSUSE_Dockerfile for now, since it is still broken on Google's side

# Submodules
 The Shaka uses curl as submodule. Please make sure you are pointed to the correct branch (the same as original Shaka branch). Don't update it, otherwise it will break the build.

# Sync with Transcoder's version of Shaka
 - added ID3 support
