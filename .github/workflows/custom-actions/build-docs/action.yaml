name: Build Shaka Packager Docs

description: |
  A reusable action to build Shaka Packager docs.
  Leaves docs output in the "gh-pages" folder.
  Only runs in Linux due to the dependency on doxygen, which we install with
  apt.

runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - name: Install dependencies
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "::group::Install dependencies"
        sudo apt install -y doxygen
        python3 -m pip install \
            sphinxcontrib.plantuml \
            recommonmark \

        echo "::group::Build Sphinx docs"
        # Now build the Sphinx-based docs.
        make -C docs/ html
        echo "::endgroup::"
        echo "::group::Move ouputs"
        # Now move the generated outputs.
