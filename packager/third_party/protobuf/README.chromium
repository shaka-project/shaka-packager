This code has been patched to ensure that files in the target protobuf_lite
do not include headers from protobuf_full. See r173228 for the patch.

This code has been patched to make the target protobuf_lite a component so that
targets that depend on it can be componentized. See http://crbug.com/172800 for
details, and r179806 for the patch.

Notes about Java:
We have not forked the Java version of protobuf-lite, so the Java version does
not support unknown field retention.

The list of Java files included in the lite profile for Java is parsed from the
maven java/pom.xml by the script protobuf_lite_java_parse_pom.py. See
'javac_includes' variable in protobuf_lite_javalib GYP target.
