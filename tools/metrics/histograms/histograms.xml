This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of Chrome histograms along
with a detailed description for each histogram.

Please pretty-print and validate your edits by running the pretty_print.py
and validate_format.py scripts in the same directory as this file before
uploading your change for review.

Take a moment to page through the contents of this file. You will find
three sections:

* The histograms section describes base histograms, giving their name,
  and optionally their units or enum type, a short one-line summary,
  and optionally a more detailed description.
* The enums section defines and documents the enumerated types referred to by
  the histograms.
* The fieldtrials section defines active field trials and their groups, along
  with their descriptions.

Each field trial lists the histograms that it affects. The complete list of
histograms is computed by appending the field trial group names to each of
the affected histograms. For example, define the following:

  <histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>

  <fieldtrial name="SuperHttpExperiment">
    <group name="SuperHttpEnabled"/>
    <group name="SuperHttpDisabled"/>
    <affected-histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>
  </fieldtrial>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  FileLoadLatency
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpEnabled
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpDisabled

Field trial definitions can currently be used in any situation where multiple
suffixes need to be appended to a histogram name; they do not have to
correspond to actual field trials in the Chrome source code.

TODO(mlloyd): Refactor the XML so that field trials can be distinguished from
other types of suffix sets.

    LANs, all negative results (even when the DNS cache might otherwise help)

    resolutions should be done when a primary resolution (or navigation) takes

    Since this is per-sub-process, you can get the average number of glyph pages
    in the system by multiplying this number with the average number of
    renderers. Note that this typically won't count the glyph pages added as a
    result of the load that just committed, since layout will happen after the
    commit. There are 512 bytes per glyph page, but this number also very
    closely approximates the number of glyph width map pages in the same
    renderer. The only difference is that if you have font fallback, it will
    make a new glyph page and no width page, but in most common cases there is
    no fallback). Width pages are 1K each (256 floats), so you could think of
    this value as being the number of &quot;1.5K units related to glyphs per

    happens when a search is being suggested, and we preconnect to the search

    specifies 'zh' (general Chinese), a language code that the Translate server
    does not support.  In this case, CLD can detect a subcode like '-TW' or
    '-CN', resulting in language codes 'zh-TW' and 'zh-CN', which the Translate

    view.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Every time a CSS property is parsed on a page, that property is recorded as
    having been used. The histogram is updated with this data whenever a page is
    closed, or a page navigation happens. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a
    CSS property (eg width, border-radius). The exception is the bucket numbered
    '1' - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were counted on.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Internally, each WebCore::Page has a WebCore::UseCounter instance, with
    booleans recording use of each CSS property - one boolean per property. Upon
    destruction of the WebCore::Page (e.g. by the user closing the tab), or a
    page navigation happening, the histogram is updated. For each boolean that
    is set to True, the corresponding histogram bucket for that CSS property is
    incremented by 1. The page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) is always
    incremented by 1 on each histogram update.

    Deprecated as of 8/2013. This histogram only considered the leaf certificate
    expiry date as a proxy for whether a certificate was in-scope for the BRs,
    but did not consider the issuance date. As some CAs have issued long-lived
    certs prior to the BRs, this disproportionately reported those certs as
    being subject to the BRs, but non-compliant, when in reality they're not
    subject.
