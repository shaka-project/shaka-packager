# There are three kinds of suppressions in this file:
# 1. Third party stuff we have no control over.
#
# 2. Intentional unit test errors, stuff that is somehow a false positive
# in our own code, or stuff that is so trivial it's not worth fixing.
#
# 3. Suppressions for real chromium bugs that are not yet fixed.
# These should all be in chromium's bug tracking system.
# Periodically we should sweep this file and the bug tracker clean by
# running overnight and removing outdated bugs/suppressions.
#
# TODO(rnk): Should we move all of the Linux-only system library suppressions
# over from suppressions.txt?  We'd avoid wasting time parsing and matching
# suppressions on non-Linux, which is basically just Mac.

   # version 3.15 or later.
