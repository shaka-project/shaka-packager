Packager Documentation
======================

Shaka Packager is a tool and a media packaging SDK for DASH and HLS packaging
and encryption. It can transmux input media files from one container to another
container.

.. note::

    Shaka Packager does not do transcoding. Content must be pre-encoded before
    passing to packager.

Packager operates in *streams*, described by *stream_descriptor*. The streams
can be read from the same "file" or different "files", which can be regular
files, pipes, udp streams, etc.

This page is the documentation on using the *packager* tool. If you are
interested in integrating *packager* library into your own tool, please see
:doc:`library`.
